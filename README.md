# Nutritional Calculator
This is a small project that helps people to know what are their caloric requirements and the nutritional macronutrients that they should be consuming.

The program asks the user the basic information of age, weight and physical activity levels, and then applies the different formulas to calculate how much calories they need to consume, and how those calories are distributed in Protein, Carbohydrates and Fats. 

The user will choose how much of each macronutrient does he/she wants to consume within an acceptable range.
